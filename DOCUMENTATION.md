# SocialX Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

SocialX is built using a **monolithic component architecture** where all functionality is contained within a single `App.js` file. This approach simplifies development and deployment while maintaining all features of a modern social media application.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **React Native 0.72.6** - Cross-platform mobile framework
- **Expo 49.0** - Development platform and build service
- **React 18.2** - UI library with hooks and context
- **React Navigation 6** - Navigation library with multiple navigator types

### Navigation Libraries
- `@react-navigation/native` - Core navigation functionality
- `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` - Tab-based navigation
- `@react-navigation/drawer` - Side drawer navigation
- `@react-navigation/stack` - Stack-based navigation

### UI and Animation
- `@expo/vector-icons` - Icon library (Ionicons)
- `moti` - Animation library built on Reanimated 2

- `react-native-gesture-handler` - Touch gesture handling

### Platform Integration
- `react-native-screens` - Native screen optimization
- `react-native-safe-area-context` - Safe area handling

## Component Architecture

### Context Providers
The app uses React Context for global state management:

#### AuthContext
Manages user authentication state and methods.
```javascript
const AuthContext = React.createContext();
```

**State Properties:**
- `user`: Current authenticated user object
- `loading`: Authentication loading state
- `login()`: Authentication method
- `logout()`: Session termination method
- `googleLogin()`: OAuth simulation method

#### ThemeContext
Handles application theming and dark/light mode switching.
```javascript
const ThemeContext = React.createContext();
```

**State Properties:**
- `theme`: Current theme object with colors
- `isDarkMode`: Boolean for current theme mode
- `toggleTheme()`: Method to switch themes

### Main Components

- Personal posts section with interaction counts
- Logout functionality

#### SettingsScreen
Application preferences and configuration.
- Theme toggle with immediate visual feedback
- Notification preferences
- Privacy settings toggles
- About section navigation

## State Management Strategy

### Local State
Each screen manages its own local state using React hooks:
- `useState` for component-level data
- `useContext` for accessing global contexts
- `useEffect` for side effects and lifecycle management

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: AuthContext provides user state globally
2. **Theme Management**: ThemeContext handles appearance across all components
3. **Post Interactions**: Local state updates with immediate UI feedback
4. **Navigation State**: React Navigation handles route management

## Animation Implementation

### Moti Integration
The app uses Moti for declarative animations:

**Common Animation Patterns:**
```javascript
// Entrance Animation
from={{ opacity: 0, translateY: 20 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, translateY: 0 }}
transition={{ type: "timing", duration: 500 }}

// Scale Animation (buttons)
animate={{ scale: focused ? 1.1 : 1 }}
transition={{ type: "spring", damping: 15 }}

// Staggered Animations
transition={{ delay: index * 100 }}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Animations run on the native thread via Reanimated 2
- Smooth 60fps performance across devices
- Memory-efficient animation cleanup

## Navigation Structure

### Hierarchy
```
App
├── AuthProvider
├── ThemeProvider
└── NavigationContainer
    └── DrawerNavigator
        ├── TabNavigator
        │   ├── FeedScreen
        │   ├── ImagesScreen
        │   ├── ProfileScreen
        │   └── SettingsScreen
        ├── ProfileScreen (duplicate for drawer access)
        └── SettingsScreen (duplicate for drawer access)
```

### Navigation Features
- **Deep Linking**: Configured with custom scheme `socialx://`
- **State Persistence**: Navigation state maintained across app lifecycle
- **Gesture Support**: Full swipe and touch gesture integration

## Performance Optimizations

### FlatList Optimization
- Proper `keyExtractor` implementation
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo patterns
- Optimized `getItemLayout` for known dimensions

### Image Handling
- Lazy loading for grid images
- Proper aspect ratio maintenance
- Memory management for large image sets

### Bundle Size
- Tree shaking for unused dependencies
- Optimized import statements
- Minimal third-party dependencies

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (Demo)
- Mock authentication for development
- No real user data storage
- Client-side only validation

### Production Recommendations
- Implement JWT token authentication
- Server-side validation for all inputs
- Encrypted storage for sensitive data
- HTTPS-only communication
- Input sanitization for user content

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Recommended test coverage:
- Context providers and their methods
- Component prop handling and state changes
- Navigation flow between screens
- Animation trigger conditions

### Integration Testing
- Authentication flow end-to-end
- Post interaction workflows
- Theme switching functionality
- Navigation between all screens

### Platform Testing
- iOS device testing (various screen sizes)
- Android device testing (multiple API levels)
- Performance testing on lower-end devices

## Build Configuration

### Expo Configuration (app.json)
- Platform-specific settings for iOS and Android
- Asset bundling and optimization
- Build number and version management
- Permission declarations

### Babel Configuration
- Reanimated 2 plugin integration
- Expo preset for React Native compatibility
- Module resolution optimization

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
```bash
expo start          # Start development server
expo start --tunnel # Use tunnel for testing on devices
```

### Production Builds
```bash
expo build:android  # Android APK/AAB
expo build:ios     # iOS Archive
```

### Distribution
- Google Play Store for Android
- Apple App Store for iOS
- Expo deployment for over-the-air updates

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Recommended Integration
- Crash reporting (Sentry/Bugsnag)
- Analytics tracking (Firebase Analytics)
- Performance monitoring (Flipper)
- User feedback collection

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Limitations
- Single-file architecture limits maintainability at scale
- Mock data doesn't represent real-world performance
- No offline capability or data persistence

### Scaling Recommendations
1. **Modular Architecture**: Split into separate component files
2. **State Management**: Consider Redux or Zustand for complex state
3. **Backend Integration**: REST API or GraphQL implementation
4. **Database**: Local storage with SQLite or Realm
5. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for live updates
6. **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging integration

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Consistent component naming (PascalCase)
- Descriptive function and variable names
- Proper JSDoc comments for complex functions
- ESLint configuration for code consistency

### Best Practices
- Component separation by functionality
- Proper prop validation with PropTypes
- Error boundary implementation
- Accessibility features (screen reader support)
- Internationalization preparation (i18n)

### Debug Tools
- React Developer Tools integration
- Flipper for network and state debugging
- Expo debugging tools
- Metro bundler logging
